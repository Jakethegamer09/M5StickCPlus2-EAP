# M5StickCPlus2-EAP


These are several .HTML files to add on to your M5StickCPlus2, I am using Bruce firmware, others might not work, or be supported.

Assuming you have Bruce flashed. Go to Files (on the m5) and then WebUI. 
After Connecting to the WebUI, I made a new folder and added them by dragging and dropping on bruce.local (admin/bruce are default credentials)
